        "## -------- Introduction to Eurodollar Futures and Options --------\n",
        "\n",
        "### Eurodollar futures:\n",
        "A benchmark for investors globally, Eurodollar futures provide a valuable, cost-effective tool for hedging fluctuations in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Eurodollars are U.S. dollars deposited in commercial banks outside the United States.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eurodollar futures prices reflect market expectations for interest rates on three-month Eurodollar deposits for specific dates in the future. The final settlement price of Eurodollar futures is determined by the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on the last trading day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eurodollar futures were the first futures contract to be settled in cash, rather than physically-delivered. A total of 40 quarterly futures contracts, spanning ten years, plus the 4 nearest serial (non-quarterly) months are listed at all times. Serial Eurodollar futures are identical to the quarterly contracts except they expire in months other than those in the March, June, September and December quarterly cycle. Today approximately 98% of Eurodollar futures trade electronically on CME Globex electronic trading platform. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Packs and Bundles\n",
        "Packs and Bundles provide convenient alternatives for executing strips of Eurodollar futures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eurodollar Packs are the simultaneous purchase or sale of an equally weighted, consecutive series of four Eurodollar futures contracts, quoted on an average net change basis from the previous day’s close. Packs, like Eurodollar futures, are designated by a color code that corresponds to their position on the yield curve. There are always 37 Packs listed for trading at a given time. The most common are: Red, Green, Blue, Gold, Purple, Orange, Pink, Silver and Copper, corresponding to Eurodollar futures years 2-10, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eurodollar Bundles allow you to simultaneously buy or sell consecutive series of Eurodollar futures in equal proportions, typically beginning with the front quarterly contract. This means that a 5-year “strip” comprised of 20 individual contracts can be executed with just one transaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The price of a Eurodollar Pack or Bundle is quoted in terms of the average net change from the previous day’s settlement prices for the entire group of contracts in the pack or bundle. Bundles and Packs are quoted in minimum .25 tick increments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of Eurodollars\n",
        "\n",
        "- Unsurpassed liquidity - consistently tight bid/offer spreads\n",
        "- Lower transaction costs\n",
        "- Diverse trading opportunities\n",
        "- Price transparency\n",
        "- Mid-curve options offer a low premium, high time decay\n",
        "\n",
        "### Eurodollar Options\n",
        "Options on Eurodollar futures are among the most actively traded exchange-listed (ETD) interest rate options contracts in the world, trading over 1.4 million contracts per day in 2018. The liquidity of Eurodollar options offers traders and hedgers an opportunity to take advantage of their views on the direction of U.S. interest rates. Opportunities range from high gamma one-week options, to high vega options expiring up to four years in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eurodollar options provide the ability to limit losses while maintaining the possibility of profiting from favorable changes in the futures prices. All Eurodollar options are American-style, meaning that the options may be exercised on or before expiration.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to 16 quarterly and 4 serial options, Eurodollars also offer ***Mid-Curve options***. Mid-Curve options are short-dated American-style options on deferred Eurodollar futures contracts, one, two, three, four and five years from the options expiration date. These options give the ability to trade options expiring at the same time on different parts of the curve. Because they are short-dated, Mid-Curve options offer a low premium, high time decay alternative in this segment of the yield curve.\n",
        "\n",
        "Weekly expirations on the 1-year, 2-year and 3-year Mid-Curve options are also listed, which allow you to take a view on upcoming economic releases and the effects upon U.S. interest rate markets.\n",

        "\n",
        "- EDZ0, the Dec 2020 Eurodollar futures contract settling on Mon, 14-Dec-2020, is the “1st White, ED1” contract and is trading at 99.65. \n",
        "- The “stub rate” (from 8-Oct-2019 to 14-Dec-2020) is 0.30% (Act/360 basis). \n",
        "- We buy a “95 Put” (strike = 99.50) for 5 ticks. Expiration date of the put is the same as ED1’s settlement date (14-Dec-2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "The next day, Fri, 9-Oct-2020: \n",
        "\n",
        "- the market has sold off by 5 bp and EDZ0 is now trading at 99.60. \n",
        "- The stub rate (from 9-Oct-2020 to 14-Dec-2020) is now 0.35%. \n",
        "- Your “95 Put” is now trading at 6.25 ticks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Nice job: 1-day return of 25%! Who needs Tesla?\n",
        "\n",
        "### The questions we are concerned with:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Explain our one-day P&L?\n",
        "\n",
        "The P&L is 25%. It is composed of the contribution of 5 Greeks, in which Delta contributes the most. What’s more, compared with other parameters, stub rate and forward rate have the biggest change. However, the stub rate has such a small weight that its change doesn’t influence the option price a lot. Hence, at that time, forward rate and delta dominate the P&L. So it shows that an increase of fwd rate generates a 25% P&L. \n",
        "\n",
        "2) On Thu, what was the implied break-even daily volatility? Was it realized?\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Over the one-day horizon what was my Gamma P&L vs. Theta P&L? (using the greeks to estimate the next day’s P&L. We are on Thur. Oct8, we want to estimate the expected pnl on Fri. Oct9. Also, the realized 1-day return on Oct9 is given by 25% as above.)\n",
        "\n",
        "4) If we had delta-hedged, what would have been the hedge? What would have been our P&L?\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Why do we need to pay attention to the stub rate?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Main Procedure:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Notices that ***a put on a Eurodollar contract is a call on its implied rate.*** \n",
        "- Firstly, we calculate the implied Normal volatility on Oct 8th (= 63.8 bp). \n",
        "- Then, calculate the option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta) using “bump and reval” on the same day. \n",
        "- Afterwards, we can solve for the implied Normal vol on Oct 9th\n",
        "- Relate the realized 1-day P&L to the expected P&L, see we can get anything? (If we have known the option price and fwd rate, then we can calculate the realized pnl. So why do we still need to estimate pnl, or expected pnl? )\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further Discuss: \n",
        "Let’s assume that we like our position and think it has more to give, but want to take some profit. What would we do?  \n",
        "\n",
        "6) dynamic hedge (reduce the position on futures as things go better)\n",
        "\n",
        "7) Straddle\n"
