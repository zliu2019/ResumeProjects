    "# VaR\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most widely used risk measures in finance, popularized by JP Morgan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given some confidence level $\\alpha$, the VaR of the portfolio at the confidence level is given by the smallest number $I$ such that the probability of the Loss $L$ exceeds $I$ is not larger than $1-\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P[L >= VaR_{\\alpha}] = 1- \\alpha$$\n",
    "where $L$ is the negative of the return to our portfolio. For example, if the return is $-600$ dollars, then $L$ would be $+600$ dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, assume we are calculating 10-day 99% VaR. The historical returns with a window size of 10-day are given by our data analyst. If we got a VaR of 10 dollars, this means \n",
    "\n",
    "- There is a 99% chance that our portfolio loss will not exceeds 10 dollar.\n",
    "- And in those 1% scenario, our portfolio loss will greater than 10 dollar on any given day.\n",
    "- i.e. we keep track of our portfolio investment for, let's say 100 days in the past. VaR tells us that, among those 100 days, there are 99 days on which our loss is less than 10 dollars. That is our Value at Risk. \n",
    "- It evalutes that, in most of the time, what is the maximum loss that we encountered. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drawbacks:\n",
    "- We do not know about what happened with that 1% area. There definitely might be a chance that the so-call \"Black Swan\" happened. Which means people will loss a large amount of money in that 1% area, that the VaR does not tell us. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Uncorrelation assumption: \n",
    "    Let an actual loss exceeds the predicted VaR threshold be known as an \"exccedance\". The VaR model assumes that exceedance events are uncorrelated with each other. In other words, if our VaR measure is set at a one-day 95% confidence level, and there is an exceedance event today, then the probability of an exceedance event tomorrow is still 5%. An exceedance event today has no impact on the probability of future exceedance events. More generally, the probability of an exceedance conditional on all available information should equal the unconditional probability of an exceedance. In other words, an exceedance event should be no more likely to occur on a Tuesday, the\n",
    "day after the market is up, or when the level of risk is high. However, it is not the case in reality.\n",

    "# Delta-Normal VaR (parametric)\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric method, also known as the variance-covariance method, is the simplest and easiest way, result is not nice, not widely-used today\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delta-normal Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any underlying asset, we assume that the log returns are normally distributed\n",
    "- For options, we approximate the returns of any option based on its delta-adjusted exposure. \n",
    "- For portfolios, the delta-normal model assumes that the relationships between securities can be fully described by their correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predictably, the results of such a simple model were often disappointing. Delta-normal models are rarely used in practice today, just an excellent starting point when learning about VaR models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "This parametric method looks at the price movements of investments over a look-back period and uses probability theory to compute a portfolio's maximum loss. It sirstly calculates the mean and standard deviation of returns. Assuming returns and volatility follow a normal distribution, the maximum loss within the specified confidence level is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with One Security:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a portfolio that includes only one security with the return $R_1$. Suppose a notional of $500,000 is invested in stock ABC. Further assume that the standard deviation over 252 days, or one trading year, of stock ABC, is 7% and it follows the normal distribution. The one-sided 95% confidence level has a z-score of 1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value at risk in this portfolio is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{notional}*z*\\sigma$$\n",
    "$$57,575 = (500000*1.645*.07)$$\n",
    "Therefore, with 95% confidence, the maximum loss will not exceed $57,575 in a given trading year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with Two Securities\n",
    "For a portfolio with two securities case, first calculate the portfolio's variance. Then multiply portfolio std by the z-score and the portfolio value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a risk manager wants to calculate the value at risk using the parametric method for a one-day time horizon. The weight of the first asset is 40%, and the weight of the second asset is 60%. The standard deviation is 4% for the first and 7% for the second asset. The correlation coefficient between the two is 25%. Following the normal distribution, the one-sided 95% confidence level has a z-score of -1.645. The portfolio value is $50 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parametric value at risk over a one-day period, with a 95% confidence level, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3.99 million = 50,000,000*(-1.645)*\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(w_1R_1+w_2R_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the delta-normal VaR of a security, we start by calculating \n",
    "\n",
    "- For non-option securities, the standard deviation of returns for the security, \n",
    "- For an option, get std for the returns of the option’s underlying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, \n",
    "\n",
    "- For non-option securities, we then multiply the return standard deviation by the absolute market value or notional of our position to get the position’s standard deviation. \n",
    "- For options, we multiply by the absolute delta-adjusted exposure. The delta adjusted exposure being the value of the underlying multiplied by the option’s delta. We then multiply the position’s standard deviation by an appropriate factor based on the inverse of the standard normal distribution (e.g. −1.64 for 95% VaR).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "we have not said anything about the expected return. In practice, most VaR models assume that the distribution of return has a ****mean of zero****. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Almost always a reasonable assumption at short horizons. \n",
    "- At longer horizons, may no longer be reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some practitioners will also assume that the ****time decay**** for options is also zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "- May also be valid in many situations, it can fail even over short time horizons. \n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, unless stated otherwise, ****assume security returns have zero mean but include theta in calculating VaR****.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "# historical VaR (non-parametric)\n",
    "very simple model for estimating VaR is historical simulation or the historical method\n",
    "\n",
    "- calculate VaR directly from past returns. \n",
    "- For example, 1-day 95% VaR for an equity using 100 days of data. The 95th percentile corresponds to the least worst of the worst 5% of returns. In this case, because we are using 100 days of data the VaR simply corresponds to the 5th worst day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- If we have the following 100 returns, sorted from lowest to highest. The 95th percentile VaR in this case corresponds to −3.37%, or, dropping the negative sign, we would say that our 1-day 95% VaR is a loss of 3.37%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an infinitely-lived underlying asset, the historical approach could not be easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For derivatives, such as equity options, or other instruments with finite lifespans, such as bonds, it is slightly more complicated. For a derivative, we do not want to know what the actual return series was, we want to know what the return series would have been had we held exactly the same derivative in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, suppose we own an at-the-money put with two days until expiry. 250 days ago, the option would have had 252 days until expiry, and it may have been far in or out of the money. We do not want to know what the return would have been for the option with 252 to expiry, we want to know what the return would have been for an at-the-money put with two days to expiry, given conditions in the financial markets 250 days ago. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarly, for a bond with 30 days to expiry, for risk purposes, we are interested in what the return of a bond with 30 days to maturity would have been 250 days ago, not what the return of a bond with 280 days to maturity was. \n",
    "\n",
    "- These constant maturity series, or back-cast series, are quite common in finance. The easiest way to calculate the back-cast series for an option would be to use a delta approximation. If we currently hold a put with a delta of −30%, and the underlying return 250 days ago was 5%, then our back-cast return for that day would be −1.5% , −1.5% = −30% × 5%. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A more accurate approach would be to fully reprice the option, taking into account not just\n",
    "changes in the underlying, but time-decay, changes in implied volatility and changes to the risk-free rate. Just as we could approximate option returns using delta, we could approximate bond returns using DV01, but a more accurate approach would be to fully reprice the bond based on changes in the relevant interest rates and credit spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "parametric vs non-parametric:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One advantage of historical VaR is that it is extremely simple to calculate. \n",
    "- Another advantage is that it is easy to explain to non-risk professionals. Most financial professionals will be used to looking at cumulative return charts. The returns used to create a cumulative return chart are the same returns used to calculate historical VaR. If there is ever a question about the validity of a historical VaR calculation it is easy enough to pull up a chart of historical returns to look for a potential source of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The delta-normal approach is an example of what we call a ***parametric model***. We say that the\n",
    "model is parametric because it is based on a mathematically defined, or parametric, distribution (in this case, the normal distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast the historical approach is non-parametric. We have not made any assumptions about the distribution of historical returns. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. The historical approach easily reproduces all the quirks that we see in historical data, changing standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, jumps, etc. Developing a parametric model that\n",
    "reproduces all of the observed features of financial markets can be very difficult. At the same time, models based on distributions often make it easier to draw general conclusions. In the case of the historical approach, it may not be easy to tell if a VaR forecast is the result of a particularly unusual set of input returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Monte Carlo simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "- a position in gold, \n",
    "- believe that the daily log returns of gold are $N( \\text{0.01% , 1.04%} )$ normally distributed with a mean of 0.01% and a standard deviation of 1.40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the VaR of this position, we could generate 1,000 draws from a normal distribution with a mean of 0.01% and a standard deviation of 1.40%, convert the log returns into standard returns, and then sort the returns from lowest to highest. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are interested in our 95% VaR, we simply select the 50th worst return from the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- very straightforward, but it is also inefficient.\n",
    "- Because the log returns are normally distributed, we know that the 5th percentile is −1.64 standard deviations below the mean, corresponding to a log return of −2.29% = 0.01% −1.64 × 1.40%.\n",
    "- The real power of Monte Carlo simulations is in more complex settings, where instruments are\n",
    "non-linear, prices are path dependent, and distributions do not have well defined inverses. \n",
    "- also useful when the relationships between securities are more complicated.\n",
    "- make it easy to calculate multi-period VaR. In the preceding example, if instead of being interested in the 1-day VaR, we wanted to know the 4-day VaR, we would simply generate four 1-day log returns, using the same distribution as before, and add them together to get one 4-day return. We could repeat this process 1,000 times, generating a total of 4,000 1-day returns. As with the 1-day example, in this particular situation, there are more efficient ways to calculate the VaR statistic. That said, it is easy to imagine how multiday scenarios could quickly become very complex. What if your policy was to reduce your position by 50% every time you suffered a loss in excess of 3%? What if returns exhibited positive serial correlation, with positive excess returns more likely to be followed by positive excess returns, and negative excess returns more likely to be followed by negative excess returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both with Parametic and Non-para:\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulations are usually based on parametric distributions, but we could also use non-parametric methods, randomly sampling from historical returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuing with our gold example, if we had 500 days of returns for gold, and we wanted to calculate the 4-day VaR, we would randomly pick a number from 1 to 500, and select the corresponding historical return. We would do this four times, to create one 4-day return. We can repeat this process, generating as many 4-day returns as we desire. \n",
    "- The basic idea is very simple, but there are some important details to keep in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "        First, generating multi-period returns this way involves what we call sampling with replacement. Pretend that the first draw from our random number generator is a 10, and we select the 10th historical return. We don’t remove that return before the next draw. If, on the second draw, our random number generator produces 10 again, then we select the same return. If we end up pulling 10 four time in a row, then our 4-day return will be composed of the same 10th return repeated four times. Even though we only have 500 returns to start out with, there are 5004\n",
    ", or 62.5 billion, possible 4-day returns that we can generate this way. This method of estimating parameters using sampling with replacement is often referred to as ***bootstrapping***. \n",
    "\n",
    "        The second detail that we need to pay attention to is serial correlation. We can only generate multi-period returns in the way just describe if single-period returns are independent of each other. For example, suppose that the standard deviation of gold has gone through long periods of high volatility followed by long periods of low volatility, and we believe our historical data accurately reflects this starting with 250 days of low volatility followed by 250 days of high volatility. If we randomly select returns with replacement, then the probability of getting a draw from the high volatility period is 1/2 each time. If our random numbers are generated independently then there is only $1/16 = (1/2)^4$ chance of drawing four returns in a row from the high period, whereas historically the probability was much closer to 1/2 (except for the transition in the middle of the sample, where we switched from low to high volatility, low volatility days were always followed by low volatility days, and high volatility days were always followed by high volatility days). \n",
    "        \n",
    "        A simple solution to this problem: instead of generating a random number from 1 to 500, generate a random number from 1 to 497, and then select four successive returns. If our random number generator generates 125, then we create our 4-day return from returns 125, 126, 127, and 128. While this method will capture any serial dependence between periods, it greatly reduces the number of possible returns. In this case, the number of possible 4-day returns is reduced from 62.5 billion to 497, and effectively reduces the Monte Carlo simulation to the historical simulation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the three methods we have considered so far, Monte Carlo simulations are generally considered to be the most flexible. Their major drawback is speed. As computers get faster and faster, the speed of Monte Carlo simulations is becoming less of an issue. Still in some situations — a trading\n",
    "desk that require real-time risk number, for example —this speed issue may still rule out the use of Monte Carlo simulations."
